    "answer1": "We begin by analyzing your hotel’s location, concept, target markets, room structure, and current channel mix. Then we create a Hotel Digital Roadmap that includes SEO, SEM, social media, web, OTA, PMS, call center, and reporting. The roadmap defines 3–6–12 month steps, priorities, and KPIs.",
    "answer2": "There isn’t a single factor—but designing the end-to-end guest journey is the key. Without aligning search (SEO/SEM), social media (SMM), website experience, OTA visibility, and call center workflows, a large share of potential demand is lost. We focus on completing the entire chain.",
    "answer3": "We increase conversion by combining fast mobile-first UX, clear offers and trust signals, accurate tracking, remarketing, call-center scripts aligned with rates/campaigns, and consistent pricing/inventory across OTA and direct channels—then iterating via dashboards and funnel diagnostics.",
    "answer4": "Yes. You can start with only Hotel SEO, only hotel ads management, or only hotel social media. However, the strongest results come when these modules integrate with PMS–OTA operations, the call center, and reporting. Often we start with a few critical blocks and scale the system in phases.",
    "answer5": "We start with a short discovery to understand your current situation and goals. Then we produce a pre-assessment highlighting strengths and gaps across SEO, SEM, SMM, OTA, PMS, and call center. Based on that, we create a prioritized transformation roadmap—launching the most critical blocks first and completing the 360° architecture step by step."

DGTLFACE designs YouTube Ads not as a standalone channel, but together with other SEM and hotel digital marketing modules, so you can see its sales contribution clearly in reports.",

    "question2": "What is the minimum budget I need for YouTube ads?",
    "answer2": "It depends on your industry, target markets, and whether your goal is awareness or performance. Trying to reach very large audiences with a very small budget is usually inefficient.

If needed, we adapt your existing assets to ad formats—or produce new creatives through <a href=\"/Services/creative/videoProduction\">video production</a> specifically for the campaign.",

Google has become better at filtering spam and manipulative links, but trustworthy, relevant, and high-quality backlinks remain one of the strongest ranking signals. The key is not old-school manipulation, but building a <b>natural profile with the right strategy</b>.",

    "question2": "Is every backlink you receive a good one?",
    "answer2": "Absolutely not. Links from irrelevant or spam sources can: <ul><li> Pollute your profile, </li><li> Create risk during algorithm updates,</li><li> Require disavow in serious cases. </li></ul> That’s why in backlink management, <b>quality and relevance</b> matter far more than quantity.",

    "question2": "Can we get only strategy & planning, and produce the content ourselves?",
    "answer2": "Yes, we can work in a <b>strategy + calendar + consulting</b> model only. In this case, DGTLFACE:<ul><li> Builds the roadmap,</li><li> Holds monthly/quarterly review meetings,</li><li> Reviews your in-house content according to the strategy. </li></ul> Still, the strongest results usually come from projects where <b>strategy and production are handled by the same team</b>.",

    "answer3": "Markets, algorithms, user behavior, and your business change continuously. That’s why a social media strategy is a structure that needs <b>periodic updates</b>. We typically recommend reviewing (and updating if needed) every 3–6 months.",

    "question4": "Are SMM strategy and advertising strategy separate?",

    "answer1": "<b>Yes</b>, ad-hoc technical support is possible. However, for <b>critical projects</b>, a planned maintenance package is usually healthier and more cost-effective. Problems are identified <b>before</b> they become incidents, and emergencies become less frequent.",

    "question2": "Does maintenance really improve website speed?",
    "answer2": "<b>Yes.</b> Regular performance checks and actions like <b>cache tuning, image optimization, and cleanup of unnecessary code/dependencies</b> have a strong impact on speed. For projects investing in <b>SEO and paid ads</b>, speed is a factor that directly affects <b>conversion rates</b>.",

    "question3": "Which tasks are included in maintenance vs. treated as a separate project?",
    "answer3": "In general:<ul><li><b>bug fixes, small content/image changes, technical checks, and security/version updates</b> are included in maintenance,</li><li><b>new modules, new pages, or large feature development</b> are handled as an additional project.</li></ul> This separation is clarified clearly during the proposal stage.",

    "question4": "My current site was built by another agency—can I still get maintenance from DGTLFACE?",
    "answer4": "<b>Yes.</b> We start with a <b>technical audit and code review</b>, then design an appropriate maintenance model. If needed, we can also create a phased plan to migrate toward a more modern architecture.",

    "question5": "How do we start a website maintenance project with DGTLFACE?",
    "answer5": "Our flow is:<ul><li>analyzing the current site and infrastructure,</li><li>clarifying <b>needs and expectations</b> (frequency, scope, responsibilities),</li><li>defining the maintenance package: <b>scope + SLA + reporting model</b>,</li><li>first “baseline maintenance” pass (cleanup, stabilization),</li><li>moving into the regular <b>monthly/periodic maintenance cycle</b>.</li></ul> Every step is <b>documented</b> and shared through regular reports."

    "question2": "Is online sales optimization too heavy for a small boutique hotel?",
    "answer2": "No. When structured correctly, it’s one of the most important levers for boutique hotels. With limited rooms, achieving <b>higher revenue</b> requires optimizing your channel set, pricing strategy, and <b>conversion-focused website experience</b>.",

    "question3": "Can we only get “consulting” and manage operations ourselves?",
    "answer3": "<b>Yes.</b> We can work as <b>analysis + strategy + reporting + consulting</b> while your team manages operations. Over time, you can also gradually hand over parts like <b>OTAs, channel management, or call center</b> if desired.",

    "question4": "How soon does online sales optimization show results?",
    "answer4": "It depends on your current setup, channel structure, and competition. Some hotels see clear improvements in conversion and revenue within <b>1–2 months</b>, while others need a <b>3–6 month</b> optimization cycle. The key is maintaining <b>test–measure–improve</b> discipline.",

    "question5": "How do we start an online sales optimization project with DGTLFACE?",

    "question2": "What’s the minimum monthly budget for hotel advertising?",
    "answer2": "It depends on your hotel size, number of markets, and goals. In general, we recommend:\n<ul>\n<li>Avoiding tiny tests that don’t generate meaningful data,</li>\n<li>Establishing a minimum band that produces actionable data per market and target occupancy.</li>\n</ul>\n\nAfter analysis, we provide a clear range and explain why going below it becomes inefficient.",

    "question3": "Is it enough to run only Google Ads or only Meta Ads?",
    "answer3": "You can get some results short-term; however:\n<ul>\n<li>Google Search → intent,</li>\n<li>Meta/Instagram → inspiration + experience + remarketing,</li>\n<li>YouTube → awareness + remarketing</li>\n</ul>\n\nWhen combined, they create the strongest outcome. DGTLFACE assigns a clear role to each channel and builds a blended strategy.",

    "answer4": "Yes. For your existing Google Ads & Meta Ads accounts, we can work with a consulting + reporting model that provides:\n\nAccount & campaign analysis,\n\nPerformance and conversion reports,\n\nOptimization recommendations.\n\nOperations can remain with you or your current agency.",

    "answer1": "<b>A front desk + call center hybrid model:</b>\n\n<ul><li>Removes phone workload from the front desk,</li><li>Ensures every guest can reach you,</li><li>Operates sales-first with KPI-based management,</li><li>Lets the front desk focus more on room operations and check-in/check-out.</li></ul>",

    "question2": "Can we set up a multilingual line only for foreign guests?",

    "question3": "We already have a call center—how would you step in?",
    "answer3": "<b>Two models:</b>\n\n<ul><li>Full outsource → all reservation lines are handed to DGTLFACE,</li><li>Hybrid → your existing call center + DGTLFACE share responsibilities by language, hours, channels, or markets.</li></ul>\n\n<b>For example:</b>\n“Daytime you, evenings us” or “TR you, DE/RU us.”",

    "question4": "Is call center data connected to the PMS and reporting systems?",
    "answer4": "Yes. Whenever possible, we set up:\n\n<ul><li>PMS integration,</li><li>Reporting dashboards (<a href=\"/Services/digitalAnalysis/digitalSalesAnalysis\">sales conversion</a>, <a href=\"/Services/digitalAnalysis/lookerStudio\">Looker Studio</a>),</li><li>Call → reservation → revenue tracking</li></ul>\n\nso you can measure call center performance clearly.",
