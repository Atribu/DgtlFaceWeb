    "header": "Frequently Asked Questions About Google Ads Management",

    "question1": "Do you review my account before starting Google Ads management?",
    "answer1": "Yes. Before starting, DGTLFACE always performs an account audit. If you have an existing account, we analyze historical data. If not, we plan a structure from scratch based on your industry and target audience. This enables more controlled and efficient execution from day one.",

    "question2": "How soon can I expect results from Google Ads?",
    "answer2": "It depends on competition, industry, and budget, but the first 2–4 weeks are typically a test & learning period. During this time, we collect data and run A/B tests. After that, optimization brings more stable and scalable performance.",

    "question3": "Is professional Google Ads management worth it with a small budget?",
    "answer3": "Absolutely. Small budgets can burn quickly when mistakes happen. With professional management, we allocate your budget to the most efficient campaigns, keywords, and targeting—so you can achieve meaningful results even with limited spend.",

    "question4": "Do you only use Search, or do you also run Display and YouTube?",
    "answer4": "We use the right mix based on your needs. Search is the core, Display is used for visibility and remarketing, and YouTube is effective for storytelling—especially in tourism. We determine the ideal combination together based on account data.",

    "question5": "How do we start Google Ads management with DGTLFACE?",
    "answer5": "We begin with a quick intro + account audit. We listen to your goals, budget, and current situation. Then we prepare a Google Ads roadmap including campaign architecture, conversion tracking, and reporting routines. After approval, we launch setup, Tag Manager & GA4 integrations, and the first optimization phase."

    "question3": "Are display ads only for brand awareness?",
    "answer3": "Display is very strong for awareness, but with the right targeting and creative it can also be conversion-driven—especially in remarketing and custom audience setups. In many cases, display meaningfully supports the sales and booking funnel.",
    "question4": "Can remarketing annoy users?",

    "question1": "What is the difference between content SEO and traditional content writing?",
    "answer1": "Traditional content usually explains a topic and ends there. Content SEO, on the other hand, starts with keyword & intent analysis, uses structures compatible with technical SEO (H tags, URLs, meta), integrates with site architecture through internal linking and cluster logic, and is continuously updated and optimized based on performance. In short, content SEO combines strategy, technology, and analysis.",

    "question2": "Does every piece of content need to generate sales or reservations?",
    "answer2": "No. Some content builds awareness and trust, some focuses on comparison, and others are conversion-oriented. What matters is having all three layers in your content portfolio and building proper transitions (internal links) between them.",

    "question3": "How long does it take to see results from content SEO?",
    "answer3": "Depending on competition and domain authority, the impact of a solid content SEO plan is typically seen as follows: indexation and small traffic increases in the first 1–3 months, ranking and traffic growth in 3–6 months, and significant traffic and conversion growth in 6–12 months. Regular content production and updates accelerate this process.",

    "question4": "Can we write the content ourselves and have you handle only the SEO?",
    "answer4": "Yes. We offer two models: we either write all content ourselves, or your team writes the content while we handle briefing, structuring, editing, and SEO optimization. In both cases, the goal is to maintain the balance between SEO, brand tone, and conversions.",

    "question1": "Are backlinks still important, or does Google ignore them now?",
    "answer1": "Yes—backlinks are still very important. Google has become better at filtering spam and manipulative links, but trustworthy, relevant, and high-quality backlinks remain one of the strongest ranking signals. The key is not old-school manipulation, but building a <b>natural profile with the right strategy</b>.",

    "question2": "Is every backlink you receive a good one?",
    "answer2": "Absolutely not. Links from irrelevant or spam sources can: <ul><li> Pollute your profile, </li><li> Create risk during algorithm updates,</li><li> Require disavow in serious cases. </li></ul> That’s why in backlink management, <b>quality and relevance</b> matter far more than quantity.",

    "question3": "Can I rank higher in SEO without doing backlink work?",
    "answer3": "It’s possible to improve up to a certain level with technical and content SEO—especially in low-competition niches. But in mid to highly competitive markets, to compete with strong rivals you typically need to activate the <b>digital authority (backlink)</b> layer as well.",

    "question4": "Do you acquire the backlinks, or do you only provide the strategy?",
    "answer4": "We work in both models:<ul><li> Strategy + analysis + roadmap only, with execution handled by you/your agency,</li><li> End-to-end: strategy, outreach, and source management handled by us.</li></ul> We decide together based on budget, goals, and risk tolerance.",

    "question5": "How do we start a backlink management project with DGTLFACE?",
    "answer5": "First, we analyze your current backlink profile and your competitors’ profiles.<ul><li> Then we determine: Is cleanup needed?</li><li> What should the target domain authority be in the short–mid–long term?</li><li> Which pages and clusters should be prioritized?</li></ul> Based on these answers, we prepare a <b>Backlink & Digital Authority Roadmap</b>. After approval, we move into the cycle of <b>cleanup → build → monitoring & reporting</b>."

    "answer1": "You can, but: <ul><li> Content becomes scattered, </li><li> Your target audience remains unclear,</li><li> Without KPIs, you won’t know what works, </li><li> Your team falls into the constant stress of “what should we post today?” </li></ul> Strategy prevents all of this and channels energy <b>toward the right direction</b>.",

    "question2": "Can we get only strategy & planning, and produce the content ourselves?",
    "answer2": "Yes, we can work in a <b>strategy + calendar + consulting</b> model only. In this case, DGTLFACE:<ul><li> Builds the roadmap,</li><li> Holds monthly/quarterly review meetings,</li><li> Reviews your in-house content according to the strategy. </li></ul> Still, the strongest results usually come from projects where <b>strategy and production are handled by the same team</b>.",

    "question3": "Is strategy a one-time thing, or does it need regular updates?",
    "answer3": "Markets, algorithms, user behavior, and your business change continuously. That’s why a social media strategy is a structure that needs <b>periodic updates</b>. We typically recommend reviewing (and updating if needed) every 3–6 months.",

    "question4": "Are SMM strategy and advertising strategy separate?",
    "answer4": "The roles of organic content and ads are different, but their strategies can’t be separate. Organic content fuels ad creatives; ad performance shows which content types work. DGTLFACE designs organic SMM strategy and advertising strategy under <b>one master plan</b> through <a href=\"/Services/smm/socialMediaAds\">social media ads</a> and <a href=\"/Services/sem\">SEM</a>.",

    "answer1": "A channel manager is <b>one component</b> of integration. If PMS, OTA, and operational workflows are not designed correctly, problems can continue. DGTLFACE works with your existing channel manager and improves <b>configuration and processes</b>.",

    "question2": "Does OTA integration completely eliminate overbooking?",
    "answer2": "A well-built and well-managed integration <b>significantly reduces</b> overbooking risk—but for maximum control you still need:<ul><li>The PMS as the <b>single source of truth</b>,</li><li>Limited manual intervention,</li><li>Regular checks for rate & inventory flows.</li></ul>\nWe implement a structure that keeps the risk as low as possible.",

    "question3": "Do we have to be on every OTA, or is it better to be selective?",
    "answer3": "Being <b>selective</b> is often healthier. DGTLFACE analyzes which OTAs truly add value based on your hotel’s segment, location, and target markets, and recommends a <b>strategic channel set</b>.",

    "question4": "Do OTA guests kill direct sales?",
    "answer4": "No—when managed correctly, OTAs can actually <b>feed</b> direct sales. You can position OTAs as an awareness and reach channel, and your website + reservation line as the final conversion channel. The key is to balance <b>pricing, content, and campaigns</b>, boosting OTA visibility while offering additional value on direct channels.",

    "answer4": "It depends on your current setup, channel structure, and competition. Some hotels see clear improvements in conversion and revenue within <b>1–2 months</b>, while others need a <b>3–6 month</b> optimization cycle. The key is maintaining <b>test–measure–improve</b> discipline.",

    "answer2": "Ideally, the healthiest approach is to run both in parallel:\n<ul><li>SEO → long-term organic visibility and ongoing traffic,</li><li>Ads (SEM, social media) → short-term quick bookings and a testing ground.</li></ul>\n\nDGTLFACE keeps <a href=\"/Services/sem\">SEM</a>\n and SEO teams at the same table to balance channels.",

    "question3": "How many months does hotel SEO take to show results?",
    "answer3": "It depends on competition, region, domain history, and content quality. Typically:\n<ul><li>Positive signals from month 3,</li><li>Strong visibility increases within 6–12 months,</li><li>Stable organic traffic and booking growth long-term (12+ months).</li></ul>\n\nThe key is to treat Hotel SEO as a process—not a campaign.",

    "question4": "If we only produce blog/content, do we still need technical SEO?",
    "answer4": "Without technical SEO, good content performs far below its potential. At minimum:\n<ul><li>Speed, mobile compatibility, basic indexing,</li><li>URL and site architecture,</li><li>Cleaning basic technical errors</li></ul>\n\nare necessary—otherwise content can’t fully deliver. DGTLFACE handles technical + content SEO together.",

    "question1": "I’m already filling occupancy through OTAs—should I still invest in digital ads?",
    "answer1": "Yes, because:\n\nOTA occupancy is commission-based,\n\nDirect bookings via your ads + website are more profitable long-term,\n\nBrand awareness, reputation, and direct guest relationships require strong owned channels.\n\nDGTLFACE doesn’t aim to “turn off” OTAs; we work to increase the share of direct sales.",

    "question2": "What’s the minimum monthly budget for hotel advertising?",
    "answer2": "It depends on your hotel size, number of markets, and goals. In general, we recommend:\n<ul>\n<li>Avoiding tiny tests that don’t generate meaningful data,</li>\n<li>Establishing a minimum band that produces actionable data per market and target occupancy.</li>\n</ul>\n\nAfter analysis, we provide a clear range and explain why going below it becomes inefficient.",

    "question3": "Is it enough to run only Google Ads or only Meta Ads?",
    "answer3": "You can get some results short-term; however:\n<ul>\n<li>Google Search → intent,</li>\n<li>Meta/Instagram → inspiration + experience + remarketing,</li>\n<li>YouTube → awareness + remarketing</li>\n</ul>\n\nWhen combined, they create the strongest outcome. DGTLFACE assigns a clear role to each channel and builds a blended strategy.",

    "question4": "We have an agency—can we get a second opinion / reporting support only?",
    "answer4": "Yes. For your existing Google Ads & Meta Ads accounts, we can work with a consulting + reporting model that provides:\n\nAccount & campaign analysis,\n\nPerformance and conversion reports,\n\nOptimization recommendations.\n\nOperations can remain with you or your current agency.",

    "question5": "How do we start a hotel advertising management project with DGTLFACE?",
    "answer5": "Our standard flow:\n\nAnalysis of your channels (SEO, Ads, social, OTA, web, call center) and current results,\n\nClarifying target markets, occupancy, and revenue goals,\n\nDefining channel roles and budget strategy,\n\nPreparing Google Ads, Meta Ads, YouTube setup and tracking infrastructure,\n\nLaunching the first campaign sets,\n\nWeekly monitoring and monthly performance & revenue reporting,\n\nSeason/campaign-based optimization and strategy updates.\n\nEvery step is transparent, KPIs are clear, and results are tied directly to reservations and revenue."

Without a channel manager, it is necessary to update each OTA one by one; This means <ul><li>high manual workload, </li><li>risk of errors, </li><li>price and stock inconsistencies</li></ul>.

When combined with remarketing, it becomes a structure that: <ul><li>calls back users who have already shown interest,</li><li>with offers and messages.</li></ul> In other words, when used with remarketing, the display serves as a \"reminder to the warm user\"."

In the correct setup, messages are tagged based on subject (reservation, information, complaint, offer, etc.), separate script and SLA sets are defined for multilingual needs (such as TR–EN–DE–RU), and if necessary, the offer–reservation process is carried out with the same discipline by connecting to PMS/reservation flows.

In measurement; Channel-based message volume, response rate, first response time, resolution time, message-to-booking conversion and satisfaction feedback are tracked as basic KPIs.

Core measurement set; It consists of total call volume, response rate, lost call rate, waiting time, service level (e.g. 80/20%), AHT (average call time), first call resolution rate (FCR), complaint/resolution times, CSAT/NPS and reservation conversion metrics. Analysis in the hotel world; It should be broken down by channel (telephone, callback, etc.), language (TR–EN–DE–RU), segment (individual, agency, MICE) and campaign (early booking, no-show tracking). Reporting; The trend should be read through target/benchmark comparison and correlation between metrics (e.g. does conversion decrease as waiting time increases?) and should be linked to the action cycle: analysis → action → follow-up. Agent efficiency; It should be monitored with occupancy (talking + after-call work), adherence (shift compliance), calls/reservations per agent, quality scores and complaint rates. Wrong KPI setup (only quantity or only time-oriented) can reduce quality and disrupt team motivation; In the right model, KPIs are used for coaching, training, capacity planning and revenue optimization. A healthy performance analysis; It increases both the service level and conversion by making the impact of the correct shift plan, correct training/script revision, outbound callback efficiency and channel-based marketing investments visible."

In a healthy model, OTA reservations flow to PMS via channel manager, web booking engine works integrated with PMS or channel manager, and call center reservations are opened in PMS with standard fields (source/channel, segment, note format). Thus, the risk of overbooking is reduced, reservations that do not fall into the PMS are detected early, and pick-up/forecast data becomes reliable for revenue management. Critical control points; mapping and log tracking, daily/weekly comparison reports, single-center management of stop-sell/closing decisions and buffer inventory approach in certain periods. Guest data integrity (email, country, segment, preference) is the primary fuel for CRM, remarketing and loyalty beyond booking; Disorganized records produce invisible losses on both the operational and revenue sides. Especially in high-volume destinations such as Antalya–Belek–Kemer–Side–Bodrum–Alanya, standardizing processes with written SOPs, regular inspection of integrations and periodic control of reports transform reservation management from a \"source of stress\" into a system that preserves income and reputation."
