    "answer1": "We begin by analyzing your hotel’s location, concept, target markets, room structure, and current channel mix. Then we create a Hotel Digital Roadmap that includes SEO, SEM, social media, web, OTA, PMS, call center, and reporting. The roadmap defines 3–6–12 month steps, priorities, and KPIs.",
    "answer2": "There isn’t a single factor—but designing the end-to-end guest journey is the key. Without aligning search (SEO/SEM), social media (SMM), website experience, OTA visibility, and call center workflows, a large share of potential demand is lost. We focus on completing the entire chain.",
    "answer3": "We increase conversion by combining fast mobile-first UX, clear offers and trust signals, accurate tracking, remarketing, call-center scripts aligned with rates/campaigns, and consistent pricing/inventory across OTA and direct channels—then iterating via dashboards and funnel diagnostics.",
    "answer4": "Yes. You can start with only Hotel SEO, only hotel ads management, or only hotel social media. However, the strongest results come when these modules integrate with PMS–OTA operations, the call center, and reporting. Often we start with a few critical blocks and scale the system in phases.",
    "answer5": "We start with a short discovery to understand your current situation and goals. Then we produce a pre-assessment highlighting strengths and gaps across SEO, SEM, SMM, OTA, PMS, and call center. Based on that, we create a prioritized transformation roadmap—launching the most critical blocks first and completing the 360° architecture step by step."

    "question2": "How soon can I expect results from Google Ads?",

DGTLFACE designs YouTube Ads not as a standalone channel, but together with other SEM and hotel digital marketing modules, so you can see its sales contribution clearly in reports.",

    "question2": "What is the minimum budget I need for YouTube ads?",
    "answer2": "It depends on your industry, target markets, and whether your goal is awareness or performance. Trying to reach very large audiences with a very small budget is usually inefficient.

    "answer3": "Yes. However, they often aren’t perfectly aligned with ad requirements (duration, hook, CTA, vertical/horizontal ratios). If needed, we adapt your existing assets to ad formats—or produce new creatives through <a href=\"/Services/creative/videoProduction\">video production</a> specifically for the campaign.",

Google has become better at filtering spam and manipulative links, but trustworthy, relevant, and high-quality backlinks remain one of the strongest ranking signals. The key is not old-school manipulation, but building a <b>natural profile with the right strategy</b>.",

    "question2": "Is every backlink you receive a good one?",
    "answer2": "Absolutely not. Links from irrelevant or spam sources can: <ul><li> Pollute your profile, </li><li> Create risk during algorithm updates,</li><li> Require disavow in serious cases. </li></ul> That’s why in backlink management, <b>quality and relevance</b> matter far more than quantity.",

    "question2": "Can we get only strategy & planning, and produce the content ourselves?",
    "answer2": "Yes, we can work in a <b>strategy + calendar + consulting</b> model only. In this case, DGTLFACE:<ul><li> Builds the roadmap,</li><li> Holds monthly/quarterly review meetings,</li><li> Reviews your in-house content according to the strategy. </li></ul> Still, the strongest results usually come from projects where <b>strategy and production are handled by the same team</b>.",

    "question3": "Is strategy a one-time thing, or does it need regular updates?",
    "answer3": "Markets, algorithms, user behavior, and your business change continuously. That’s why a social media strategy is a structure that needs <b>periodic updates</b>. We typically recommend reviewing (and updating if needed) every 3–6 months.",

    "question4": "Are SMM strategy and advertising strategy separate?",
    "answer4": "The roles of organic content and ads are different, but their strategies can’t be separate. Organic content fuels ad creatives; ad performance shows which content types work.

  "faq": {
    "header": "FAQ – Frequently Asked Questions About Social Media Content Production",

    "question1": "Do you produce content completely from scratch, or can you also use our existing visuals?",
    "answer1": "We can do both. We can produce from scratch—concept, photo & video shoots, design + copy. Or we can turn your existing photos and videos into professional designs and Reels. The most efficient model is often a <b>hybrid</b> of the two.",

    "question2": "How many pieces of content should we produce per month?",
    "answer2": "It depends entirely on your industry, goals, and budget. In hotels and tourism, a common starting point is:<ul><li>3–5 feed posts per week,</li><li>3–5 story flows per week,</li><li>At least 1–2 Reels per week</li></ul> But at DGTLFACE, we first listen to your goals & budget, then define the right content volume.",

    "question3": "Can we get only design, and write the captions ourselves?",
    "answer3": "Yes. We can work with design-only, caption/copy-only, or a fully end-to-end model: “strategy + design + copy + Reels + reporting.” Still, the best results usually come when <b>the entire process is managed by a single aligned team</b>.",

    "question4": "Does content production really make a difference in ad performance?",
    "answer4": "Absolutely. Strong content:<ul><li>Increases click and engagement rates of ad creatives,</li><li>Strengthens brand perception and improves remarketing performance,</li><li>Improves “first impression” on your profile, which also affects DM/phone/form conversions.</li></ul> So content is not the “spend layer” of advertising—it’s one of the <b>core layers that determines performance</b>.",

    "question5": "How do we start a content production project with DGTLFACE?",
    "answer5": "The process goes like this:<ul><li>We discuss your brand, audience, and goals.</li><li>We analyze your current account and content.</li><li>We define content categories, tone & visual language, formats, and monthly content volume.</li><li>We prepare a content calendar and a pilot set of sample designs.</li><li>After approval, we move into a regular production + reporting loop.</li></ul>"
