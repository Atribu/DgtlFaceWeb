    "question3": "How do you improve hotel booking conversion rates?",
    "question4": "Can we start with only one module (e.g., only Hotel SEO or only Ads)?",
    "question5": "How do we start a hotel digital marketing project with DGTLFACE?",

    "answer1": "We begin by analyzing your hotel’s location, concept, target markets, room structure, and current channel mix. Then we create a Hotel Digital Roadmap that includes SEO, SEM, social media, web, OTA, PMS, call center, and reporting. The roadmap defines 3–6–12 month steps, priorities, and KPIs.",
    "answer2": "There isn’t a single factor—but designing the end-to-end guest journey is the key. Without aligning search (SEO/SEM), social media (SMM), website experience, OTA visibility, and call center workflows, a large share of potential demand is lost. We focus on completing the entire chain.",
    "answer3": "We increase conversion by combining fast mobile-first UX, clear offers and trust signals, accurate tracking, remarketing, call-center scripts aligned with rates/campaigns, and consistent pricing/inventory across OTA and direct channels—then iterating via dashboards and funnel diagnostics.",
    "answer4": "Yes. You can start with only Hotel SEO, only hotel ads management, or only hotel social media. However, the strongest results come when these modules integrate with PMS–OTA operations, the call center, and reporting. Often we start with a few critical blocks and scale the system in phases.",
    "answer5": "We start with a short discovery to understand your current situation and goals. Then we produce a pre-assessment highlighting strengths and gaps across SEO, SEM, SMM, OTA, PMS, and call center. Based on that, we create a prioritized transformation roadmap—launching the most critical blocks first and completing the 360° architecture step by step."
